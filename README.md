# Aim Game

### by Leo and Ruzeb

Our best effort at an Aimlab clone made in vanilla JS.
If you're curious on how to go about absolutely obliterating the dom, look no further!
DM us if you have tips/critiques/questions or just a highscore on [Codesmith's homepage](https://codesmith.io/)ðŸ˜Ž

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Open chrome and go to [your extensions page](chrome://extensions/)
3. In the top left of the page, click "Load Unpacked"
4. That's itâ€”just go to a website of your choosing and click on the extension!

## Quick Note

This extension saves a copy of the DOM on whatever website you launch the extension from and will "put itself back together" after the timer runs out. With that said, maybe don't run it on your back account.
